\section{Abstract}
Our plan for the lab is to modify the Nyuzi GPGPU \cite{NYUZI} by substituting
the Multiply-Accumulate-Unit (MAC) within it. The substitute modules shall use approximate computing methodologies. We will compare the two implementations
by establishing a Quality of Result (QoR) metric. This metric shall include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frames per second (FPS)
    \item Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
    \item Energy Consumption
    \item Area Consumption
\end{itemize}

The goal should be to improve the FPS by this approach while sustaining a 
humanly undetectable quality loss. Furthermore we hope to reduce
the energy consumption and the area needed for the Nyuzi 
Implementation.\\

Our approach would be to use approximate adders for the integer operations
and for the floating point operations \cite{Mittal:2016:STA:2891449.2893356}.
