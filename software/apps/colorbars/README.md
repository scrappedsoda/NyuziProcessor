This app is largely based on rotozoom but it doesn't rotate and doesn't zoom :)
Although you can certainly make it do both.
This app draws colorbars and toggles between that and noise.
While drawing, we slowdown one thread by doing printf so one can clearly see
how the 4 threads collaborate to draw the entire screen.
