This static library is linked with programs to provide OS-like functionality.
This includes POSIX system calls and driver functions for peripherals like the
UART.

There are two variants of this library. The 'bare-metal' version runs as a
standalone executable with no operating system support and the MMU disabled.
The 'kernel' runs as a user mode program loaded by os/kernel and makes system
calls where necessary.

The kernel version must be linked at an address greater than 0x1000.
The bare metal version must be linked at address 0.

The kernel version is a work in progress. A number of system calls are not yet
implemented.
