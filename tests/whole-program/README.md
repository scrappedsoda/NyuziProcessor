This is a set of whole-program tests, like the 'test-suite' project in LLVM.
The test script runs these programs for the target and compares the output
to regular expressions embedded in source code comments prefixed with 'CHECK:'.
This is similar to DejaGnu and llvm-lit. Each file is a standalone program.

I've grabbed snippets of code from a variety of open source projects to get
coverage of different coding styles and idioms. 3rd party programs retain
their own licenses, which are indicated in the top of each file. These
tests are all single threaded.

To run all tests:

    ./runtest.py

To run a specific test:

    ./runtest.py *program names*

To run only on emulator:

    ./runtest.py --target emulator *program names*

- The test script skips filenames that begin with underscore, which is
  useful for known failing cases.
- This skips tests with "noverilator" in the filename (used for tests that
  take too long to run in verilator).
- This runtest script supports '--target host' to run on host machine.
  Some tests fail in this configuration because they use intrinsics
  that exist only for Nyuzi.
