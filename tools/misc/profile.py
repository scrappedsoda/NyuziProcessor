"""Process sampling profiler output from hardware model.

USAGE: profile <objdump file> <pc dump file>
Prints a breakdown of time spent per function.
- 'objdump file' parameter points to a file that was produced using:
  /usr/local/llvm-nyuzi/bin/llvm-objdump -t <path to ELF file>
- 'pc dump file' points to a file that was produced by the verilog model
  using +profile=<filename>.  It is a list of hexadecimal program counter
  samples, one per line.
