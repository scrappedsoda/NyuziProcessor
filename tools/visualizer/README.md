The visualizer app displays thread states over time. The +statetrace flag
causes the Verilog simulator to write state traces to a text file
called statetrace.txt, which the visualizer reads.

If you are running on MacOS X, download and install a recent version of the
JDK:

<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

To build, type 'make'.

Launch the visualizer as follows:

    java -jar visualizer.jar statetrace.txt

A window will pop up which will display the trace.  It displays each thread
as a horizontal strip.

![state-trace](https://raw.github.com/wiki/jbush001/NyuziProcessor/state-trace.png)

- Black: Instruction FIFO is empty (instruction cache miss or restart
  penalty after a thread rollback)
- Red: Data cache load miss or store buffer is full.
- Yellow: Operand dependency
- Orange: Writeback conflict.  Instructions with different latencies would arrive
  at the writeback stage at the same time.
- Green: Thread is ready to run

The narrow blue strip at the bottom shows when the processor issues instructions.
Gaps represent times when it cannot issue an instruction because all threads are
blocked.
